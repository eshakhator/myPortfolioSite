        <p>I created my first animated short film in the spring of 2023. I started this project for the group of people
            out there whose entire social experience is altered because of a genetic condition. People who struggle with
            their identity and self-image because they have to go their whole life correcting assumptions and justifying
            their culture. People at a young age who felt like their own presence was an anomaly and struggled to
            explain that feeling to others. People of color who drew oculocutaneous albinism from the genetic mutation
            lottery.</p>
        <p>But I truly made this for the eight year-old me who endured as a group of older kids shrieked and ran away at
            the sight of me in the elementary school bathroom. They called me a ghost.</p>

        <h3>Instagram Post Data</h3>
        <p>I posted "Ghost" to Instagram on International Albinism Awareness Day and it was boosted by the National
            Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH) who shared it to their story. So my film reached a lot
            of people.</p>
        <p>Here is a pie chart constructed from the post's engagment data.</p>
