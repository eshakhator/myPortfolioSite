        <h3>About me!</h3>
        <p>
            Hi there! You may know me as Esha or ether or etherspayce, and I am a CS major who happens to draw from time
            to time.
            I have low vision but I have always had creative hobbies and I didn't let poor eyesight and terrible
            hand-eye coordination stop me. Digital art allows me to create art more easily and with less strain thanks
            to
            features like zoom-in and the stabilizer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please check out some of my work at my Instagram and if you're interested, you can buy
            my work on mugs, totes, stickers, and more on my Redbubble shop!
        </p>
        <p>
            Take care!
        </p>
